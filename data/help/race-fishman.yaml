  FISHMAN RACE OVERVIEW

    Fishmen hatch in coral sanctums lit by bioluminescent scripture, each child
  blessed by tides that remember the first sea kings. They bring the ocean
  with them wherever they travel: braided kelp charms, shark-tooth tattoos,
  and tales of sunken palaces. Many serve as maritime arbiters, enforcing
  treaties between surface dwellers and the abyss with tidal justice.

    Their bodies are slabs of muscle tuned for crushing depths. Strength and
  health skyrocket, letting fishmen dominate melee engagements, while mana and
  agility rise more modestly. In water or heavy rain they gain dramatic surges
  of power, making them terrifying ambushers or guardians of river crossings.
  Their challenge lies on dry land where their style feels heavier - plan
  routes that leverage water, and use fishman karate to turn even a puddle
  into a weapon.
