  NOBILITY RACE OVERVIEW

    The Nobility are pureblood vampires who etched their dominion across moonlit
  continents before humans learned to forge iron. Their courts drift in
  floating citadels carved from obsidian and star-metal, where etiquette is as
  lethal as any fang. They consider themselves curators of civilization,
  pruning kingdoms like gardens to maintain a "proper" cosmic order.

    These aristocrats blend brutal strength with refined intellect, enjoying
  enormous health and mana pools that grow in tandem. They can dominate foes
  through sanguine sorcery, shrug off most mortal afflictions, and regenerate
  under starlight. Daylight remains their undoing, sapping speed and
  resilience, so Nobility players must plan hunts, use thralls or shadows for
  cover, and accept that arrogance is as dangerous as sunlight.
