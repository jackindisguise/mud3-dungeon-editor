  DUNPEAL RACE OVERVIEW

    Dunpeals are the melancholy offspring of noble vampires and mortals. They
  wander between night-worshiping courts and fearful villages, collecting
  whispered tales of both parents' empires while belonging fully to neither.
  Ancient swords, folded parasols, and sun-shy steeds are their constant
  companions as they serve as hunters of feral bloodlines - proof that hunger
  can be mastered.

    Their hybrid nature yields agile, strong fighters who recover quickly and
  wield respectable mana reserves for blood arts or shadow barriers. Strength
  and agility grow in equal cadence, letting dunpeals move with lethal grace,
  while intellect advances more cautiously. Sunlight penalties and a constant
  need to balance predatory instincts mean they demand thoughtful play: strike
  decisively under moonlit advantages, shore up your magical defenses, and
  retreat before daylight saps your edge.
