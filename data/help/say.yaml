  SAY - In-Character Speech

  Usage:
    say <message>
    '<message>

  The say command allows you to speak to other players and NPCs in the same
  room as you. This is the primary way to communicate in-character and engage
  in roleplay with others in your immediate vicinity.

  Examples:
    say Hello, traveler!
    say How are you doing today?
    'This is a shortcut for say
    s~ Autocompletes to "say"

  Features:
    - Messages are only visible to players/NPCs in your current room
    - Your character's name is shown to others
    - You see your own message prefixed with "You say:"
    - Others see it as "[Your Name] says,"

  Note: Unlike OOC (out-of-character) messages, say is used for in-character
  roleplay and conversation. Only characters in the same room can hear you.
