  KENKU RACE OVERVIEW

    Kenku once soared on obsidian wings before an ancient curse bound them to
  city gutters. They obsessively collect sounds - snatches of laughter, blade
  clashes, treaties whispered behind curtains - then rearrange them into eerie
  mimicry. Many work as spies or storytellers, using mimic-call talents to
  unsettle rivals and barter secrets for roost rights.

    Superlative agility and keen intellect make kenku natural rogues,
  infiltrators, and illusionists. Their health remains modest, but their mana
  reserves support trickery-laden spellwork. They struggle with raw strength,
  so direct slugfests are risky; instead, rely on shadow-flutter glides,
  borrowed voices, and intricate ambush plans to stay two steps ahead of
  anyone who underestimates the “mute” birdfolk.
