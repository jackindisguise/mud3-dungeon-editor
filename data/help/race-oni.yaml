  ONI RACE OVERVIEW

    Oni are blood-demons born from forbidden rituals performed beneath eclipsed
  moons. They thrive in hidden fortresses where artisans craft bone masks and
  demon drums that echo across valleys. Though feared as monsters, many oni
  adhere to warrior codes, offering duels instead of massacres and guarding
  remote villages in exchange for tribute.

    Physically, oni are unmatched juggernauts. Strength and health warp upward
  each level, letting them survive wounds that would obliterate mortals, while
  the blood-demon arts fuel brutal burst damage. Their agility and intellect
  improve more slowly, so they prefer direct confrontations to intricate spell
  duels. Keep your regeneration fueled, wield that immense vitality like a
  battering ram, and remember that subtlety is a tool - not a requirement -
  for a creature forged in chaos.
