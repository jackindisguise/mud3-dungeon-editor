  UNBLOCK - Remove a User from Your Blocked List

  Usage:
    unblock <username>      - Unblock a user
    unignore <username>     - Same as unblock (alternative command)

  The unblock command (also known as "unignore") removes a user from your
  blocked list, allowing them to send you messages on all channels again.

  Examples:
    unblock Alice
      Removes Alice from your blocked list
    
    unignore Bob
      Alternative syntax using "unignore" alias

  Features:
    - Immediate effect - user can message you as soon as unblocked
    - Case-insensitive usernames
    - Clear confirmation message when successful
    - Helpful feedback if user isn't actually blocked

  How It Works:
    - Removes the specified username from your blocked list
    - The user can immediately send you messages on any channel
    - The unblocked user is not notified of the change
    - Changes are persisted to your character file

  Notes:
    - You cannot unblock someone who isn't on your blocked list
    - Use "block" command (with no arguments) to see who you have blocked
    - Unblocking is silent - the other user won't know
    - This affects all communication channels

  Error Messages:
    - "<username> is not on your blocked list" - User isn't blocked
    - "Who do you want to unblock?" - You didn't provide a username
