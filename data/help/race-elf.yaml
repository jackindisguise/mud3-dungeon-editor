  ELF RACE OVERVIEW

    Elves trace their ancestry to the First Forest, where songs were written in
  birdsong and moonlight. Every grove still echoes with ancestral memories
  etched into bark and taught through centuries-long apprenticeships. Whether
  they leave home to study planar ley lines or to guard borderlands, elves
  carry a quiet reverence for stories, art, and the fragile thread of magic
  that binds the world together.

    Their lithe bodies and ceremonial training make them superb archers and
  spellcasters. Intelligence races ahead of other stats, feeding a vast mana
  pool that refills faster than most mortals can spend it, while agility
  sharpens their reflexes and strength lags. Elves flourish when kiting foes,
  layering wards, or delivering precision strikes; expect to withstand fewer
  direct hits, but revel in a toolkit that rewards patience, positioning, and
  a keen-focus honed over centuries.
