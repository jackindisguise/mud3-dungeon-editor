  HUMAN RACE OVERVIEW

    Humans dominate crossroads and port cities, weaving a thousand tiny kingdoms
  from sheer ambition. Their histories are short but feverishly detailed, full
  of sudden revolutions, fallen empires, and heroes who rose from nothing.
  Because their lives burn fast, humans chase novelty - some become scholars
  of ancient vaults, others mercenaries with more scars than years, but all
  are driven by possibility.

    Statistically they are the most balanced ancestry: every attribute and
  resource grows at the same steady pace. This makes humans ideal for players
  who want flexibility; you can spec into any class fantasy without fighting
  your racial baseline. They lack flashy racial powers, but their inspire
  ability and adaptable mindset let them plug gaps in any party composition
  and pivot builds mid-campaign.
