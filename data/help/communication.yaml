  COMMUNICATION - Talking in the Game

  There are several ways to communicate with other players in the game:

  In-Character (Say):
    Use the 'say' command or apostrophe shortcut to speak to players and NPCs
    in the same room as you. This is for in-character roleplay and conversation.
    
    Examples:
      say Hello, friend!
      'How are you doing?

  Out of Character (OOC):
    Use the 'ooc' command or quote shortcut to send messages that are not part
    of the in-game roleplay. These are visible to all connected players.
    
    Examples:
      ooc Hello everyone!
      "How do I find the market?

  Private Messages (Tell):
    Use the 'tell' command to send private messages to specific players.
    Use 'reply' or 'r' to respond to the last player who sent you a tell.
    
    Examples:
      tell Alice Hey, want to go hunting?
      reply Sure, meet you at the gates
      r On my way!
