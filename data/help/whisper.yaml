  WHISPER - Send Private Messages

  Usage:
    whisper <player> <message>
    tell <player> <message>
    w <player> <message>

  The whisper command (also known as "tell") allows you to send private
  messages to other players who are currently online. Only you and the
  recipient can see whispered messages.

  When you whisper to someone, they can use the "reply" command to quickly
  respond without typing your name.

  Examples:
    whisper Alice Hey, how's it going?
      Sends a private message to Alice
    
    tell Bob Meet me in the town square
      Same as whisper, alternative syntax
    
    w Carol Thanks for your help!
      Short alias for quick whispers

  Features:
    - Messages are completely private between sender and recipient
    - Color-coded with purple/pink color scheme
    - Case-insensitive player names
    - Updates recipient's reply target automatically
    - Both parties must be subscribed to the WHISPER channel

  Notes:
    - You cannot whisper to yourself
    - Both you and the recipient must have the WHISPER channel enabled
    - Use "reply" or "r" to respond to the last person who whispered to you
