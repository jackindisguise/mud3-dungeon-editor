  GOLIATH RACE OVERVIEW

    Goliaths are carved by the elements. They live atop needle-like peaks where
  storms sandblast flesh into granite, marking every warrior with swirling
  tattoos that recount ascents and victories. Tribes compete through feats of
  endurance - carrying boulders across ledges or wrestling avalanches to
  redirect them from sacred shrines.

    Unmatched strength and beefy health pools let goliaths shrug off punishment
  and control battlefields through raw presence. Their minds are practical but
  not scholarly, and mana reserves stay shallow, so their toolkit favors
  grapples, leaps, and mountain-stride resilience rather than intricate
  spellwork. If you want to carry allies through blizzards, throw enemies like
  rag dolls, and laugh at exhaustion meters, this is your race - just don't
  expect finesse or nuanced magic.
