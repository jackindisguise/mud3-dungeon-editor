  REPLY - Respond to Whispers

  Usage:
    reply <message>
    r <message>

  The reply command allows you to quickly respond to the last person who
  whispered to you without having to type their name. This is a convenient
  shortcut for continuing private conversations.

  When someone whispers to you, their username is automatically remembered.
  You can then use "reply" to send them a message back, and they in turn
  can reply to you.

  Examples:
    reply Thanks for letting me know!
      Sends a whisper to the last person who messaged you
    
    r No problem at all.
      Short alias for quick replies

  Notes:
    - You must have received at least one whisper before using reply
    - If the other player logs off, you'll be notified they're offline
    - Both you and the recipient must have the WHISPER channel enabled
