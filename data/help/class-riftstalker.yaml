  RIFTSTALKER CLASS OVERVIEW

    Riftstalkers are blade-dancers who treat reality as optional. They train in
  mirror halls where each step teaches a new angle from which to strike, then leap
  between dimensions to hunt high-value targets. Their armor is light, often little
  more than layered silks laced with planar charms.

    Agility is their lifeblood: it surges every level, feeding blink techniques,
  flanking bonuses, and evasive maneuvers. Strength and intellect trail behind but
  remain sufficient for precise strikes and utility magic. Players who crave
  high-risk, high-reward playstyles will love weaving phase strikes, teleporting
  out of danger, and deleting enemies before anyone realizes the air flickered.
