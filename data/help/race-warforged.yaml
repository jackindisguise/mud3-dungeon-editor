  WARFORGED RACE OVERVIEW

    Warforged are living constructs hammered together in arcane foundries,
  designed to fight wars long since forgotten. When peace arrived, many were
  mothballed or sold as curiosities; the rest walked away to define themselves
  beyond battlefields. Some now paint frescoes on their own armor plates,
  while others act as stoic bodyguards who never sleep.

    Their chassis grants formidable strength and towering health that scales
  faster than almost any other attribute. Integrated armor keeps them
  combat-ready without needing gear swaps, and construct-nature passives blunt
  poisons, fatigue, and environmental hazards. Mana and agility grow slowly,
  so warforged tend to favor straightforward melee builds or practical utility
  magic rather than elaborate spell rotations. If you want an indomitable
  frontline presence with a heart of gears, look no further.
