  GNOME RACE OVERVIEW

    Gnomes see the world as a puzzle begging to be rewired. Their burrow-cities
  hum with clockwork theater, rune-lit chalkboards, and festivals where new
  inventions debut alongside explosive failures. Stories abound of gnomes
  bargaining with spirits of inspiration, trading hair color or shadows for
  one more brilliant design.

    They are frail of body but unmatched in curiosity and magical finesse.
  Intelligence soars while strength barely registers, making gnomes natural
  arcanists, gadgeteers, and saboteurs. Their agility keeps them nimble enough
  to avoid direct hits, though their health pool remains slim. Approach combat
  like a laboratory experiment: set traps, exploit terrain, and use clockwork
  bolts or tinker-savant tricks to stay several steps ahead of lumbering foes.
