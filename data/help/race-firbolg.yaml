  FIRBOLG RACE OVERVIEW

    Hidden deep within emerald vales, firbolgs tend colossal trees and whisper
  to beasts in a language older than speech. They believe every creature is a
  temporary guest wearing mortal skin, so they step between hunter and prey
  when the balance tilts too far. Stories say a firbolg can vanish within
  three strides, leaving only bent grass and a gentle reprimand on the breeze.

    Their power mixes muscle and mysticism: strength and intellect both swell
  rapidly, while agility lags behind. This makes firbolgs ideal front-line
  wardens who leverage hidden-step trickery or beast-calling sorcery to
  reposition allies. They boast ample health and mana, allowing long sieges of
  nature magic, yet rely on cunning rather than speed - take your time, grow
  the battlefield to your advantage, and let patience be the deadliest weapon.
