  TIEFLING RACE OVERVIEW

    Tieflings carry the stigma of ancient infernal pacts - horns, tails, and
  ember-lit eyes remind mortals of bargains their ancestors struck in
  desperate times. Many grow up navigating suspicion, so they hone wit and
  fashion into armor, hosting secret festivals where infernal hymns mingle
  with mortal laughter.

    Their growth favors intellect and mana, making them natural warlocks, battle
  mages, and curse-weavers. Strength and agility trail behind, so they rely on
  precise positioning, protective sigils, and allies who can keep foes at bay
  while they unleash hellish-rebuke flares. If you crave dramatic spellcasting
  with rebellious flair, tieflings offer equal parts style and substance.
