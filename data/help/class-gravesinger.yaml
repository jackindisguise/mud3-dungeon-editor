  GRAVESINGER CLASS OVERVIEW

    Gravesingers weave dirges that wake bone choirs and send mourning winds through
  battlefields. They act as undertakers, archivists, and reluctant necromancers,
  recording every casualty in vellum hymnals bound with silver thread. When they
  raise their voices, the dead answer.

    Their kit is unapologetically arcane: intelligence and mana skyrocket while
  physical stats remain fragile, encouraging players to fight from behind spectral
  vanguards. Gravesingers excel at damage-over-time effects, battlefield debuffs,
  and emergency healing drawn from the same well of mournful power. Handle them
  like glass cannons fueled by requiems—devastating when given space, but reliant
  on allies to keep blades away from their throats.
