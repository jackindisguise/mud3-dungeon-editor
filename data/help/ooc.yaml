  OOC - Out of Character Communication

  Usage:
    ooc <message>
    "<message>

  The OOC command allows you to send out-of-character messages to all connected
  players. This is useful for discussing game mechanics, asking for help, or
  having conversations that aren't part of the in-game roleplay.

  Examples:
    ooc Hey everyone, how do I get started?
    ooc Is the server going down for maintenance?
    "Anyone want to team up?

  Note: OOC messages are visible to all players currently online.
