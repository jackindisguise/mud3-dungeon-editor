  WARRIOR CLASS OVERVIEW

    Warriors are the anvil upon which every campaign is forged. They train in
  drills that mix shield-walls, endurance marches, and brutal pit bouts, stepping
  onto the field clad in whatever armor they have hammered into shape. Most
  soldiers grow into legends through duty, but warriors relish the clash itself,
  proving their code through sheer persistence.

    On the mechanical side they boast immense physical power and stamina, with
  layers of plate and battlefield instincts letting them shrug off punishment.
  Their strength and health scale faster than any other attribute, while agility
  and arcane finesse lag behind, so they excel as front-line bruisers who protect
  weaker allies and control space with shield bashes, grapples, and relentless
  pressure.
