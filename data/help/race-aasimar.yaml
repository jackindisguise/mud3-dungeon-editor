  AASIMAR RACE OVERVIEW

    Descended from distant celestial patrons, aasimar walk the world as living
  beacons. Their silvered eyes and faintly glowing sigils mark them as
  emissaries of forgotten temples, sworn to keep mortals from sliding too far
  into despair. Many aasimar adopt pilgrim lives - traveling from shrine to
  battlefield - delivering quiet miracles, last rites, and the grim mercy
  their radiant lineage demands.

    In play they blend sturdy physiques with a keen mind, but their true growth
  favors intellect and deep wells of mana. Aasimar spellcraft blooms quickly,
  letting them mend, ward, or smite with equal ease, while their physical
  power rises in steady but unremarkable strides. Players seeking resilient
  casters with holy flavor will feel at home; those who crave nimble rogues
  may find the blood of the heavens a touch too solemn and deliberate.
