  SOUL REAPER RACE OVERVIEW

    Soul Reapers hail from Seireitei, a spirit metropolis whose ivory walls
  memorialize every soul they've guided onward. Each warrior bonds with a
  zanpakutō spirit - half companion, half weapon - and spends decades
  meditating on its name before unleashing the world-shaking power of shikai
  and bankai releases. They are detectives, duelists, and shepherds of the
  dead wrapped into a single, duty-bound order.

    Their training balances swordsmanship, flash-step agility, and kidō
  spellcraft, so all attributes grow evenly. Health and mana scales stay
  generous, enabling them to trade blows up close before pivoting into arcane
  bombardment. Soul Reapers shine when a player wants equal parts martial
  prowess and mystical flexibility: commune with your blade, chain techniques
  smoothly, and rely on discipline rather than brute specialization.
