  HALFLING RACE OVERVIEW

    Halflings emerge from cozy river burrows, carrying spice cakes, tall tales,
  and an uncanny knack for slipping unseen through battlefields. They value
  hearths as much as heroism, so even the boldest adventurer writes home
  nightly, promising to send maps of new taverns. Legends claim halflings once
  charmed the spirits of luck themselves, earning the right to borrow fortune
  in exchange for joyous feasts.

    Agility is their crown jewel - nimble feet and steady nerves let them dodge
  blows that would fell larger folk, while intelligence keeps them
  quick-witted. Strength barely grows, making them ill-suited to heavy armor
  or massive weapons, and their health pool requires careful positioning. Play
  them as scouts, archers, or roguish support characters who dart in, leverage
  lucky-escape tricks, and vanish before counterstrikes land.
