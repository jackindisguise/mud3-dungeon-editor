  GEOMANCER CLASS OVERVIEW

    Geomancers are earthshapers who read fault lines like scripture. They wander
  volcanic calderas and crystal caverns, bargaining with stone spirits for shards
  of power. Their armor is patterned with latticework sigils, and they carry
  satchels of gemstones to sculpt barriers or magma whips on demand.

    Statistically they strike a rare balance between muscle and intellect. Both
  physical prowess and spellcasting scale well, granting solid health, dependable
  melee swings, and a mana pool deep enough to sustain tremor wards or crystal
  salvos. They are slower than duelists and less surgical than pure mages, but they
  excel at controlling terrain, pinning foes in earthen cages, and turning any
  battlefield into a fortified stronghold.
