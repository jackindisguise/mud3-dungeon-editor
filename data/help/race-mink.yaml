  MINK RACE OVERVIEW

    Mink warriors hail from mist-wreathed jungles where lightning storms are
  treated as sacred dances. Their fur crackles with stored Electro energy, and
  during lunar festivals they slip into feral sulong states that blur the line
  between mortal and beast. Visitors describe them as endlessly curious,
  adopting foreign slang and fashions within minutes.

    Agility skyrockets for minks, granting blistering speed and evasive prowess,
  while strength and mana stay comfortably midline. Their resource pools
  support repeated bursts of Electro-claw techniques, especially when weather
  conditions turn stormy. Because they rely on mobility, they falter if pinned
  down or exhausted, so rotate targets often, time sulong awakenings
  carefully, and treat every engagement like a lightning strike - brief,
  brilliant, and devastating.
