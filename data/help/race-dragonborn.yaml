  DRAGONBORN RACE OVERVIEW

    Dragonborn trace their lineage to the titanic wyrms that once ruled the
  storm-wracked skies. Each clan keeps braided cords of scale and horn,
  retelling deeds of the ancestor whose breath gave them life. Whether bred in
  volcanic citadels or glacier caves, dragonborn live by honor-debts; choosing
  exile to the wider world is often a rite to prove they can temper draconic
  fury with mortal compassion.

    On the battlefield they are walking siege engines - heavily muscled, quick
  to anger, and able to channel devastating breath weapons. Their strength and
  health surge faster than any other attribute, making them natural front-line
  bruisers who shrug off wounds through sheer vitality and hardened scales.
  Agility and arcane nuance lag behind, so subtle spellcasting or evasive
  playstyles take more effort; lean into their raw might, towering presence,
  and ability to hold the line while allies work their craft.
