  BLOCK - Block Communication from Other Players

  Usage:
    block                   - List all blocked users
    block <username>        - Block a user
    ignore <username>       - Same as block (alternative command)

  The block command (also known as "ignore") allows you to prevent specific
  players from sending you messages on any channel. When you block someone,
  they cannot communicate with you through:
    - Whispers (private messages)
    - Say (room chat)
    - OOC (out of character)
    - Gossip
    - Any other communication channels

  To remove someone from your blocked list, use the "unblock" command.

  Examples:
    block
      Shows a list of all users you have blocked
    
    block Spammer
      Blocks the user "Spammer" from sending you any messages
    
    ignore Annoying
      Alternative syntax using "ignore" alias
    
    unblock Spammer
      Removes Spammer from your blocked list

  Features:
    - Completely silent - blocked users don't know they're blocked
    - Case-insensitive usernames
    - Persists between logins (saved to your character file)
    - Explicit block/unblock commands (no toggle confusion)
    - Works across all communication channels
    - List all blocked users with no arguments

  How It Works:
    - When someone you've blocked tries to message you, the message is
      simply not delivered to you
    - The blocked user receives no indication that you blocked them
    - They can still use commands normally, you just won't see their messages
    - You can unblock them at any time by using the "unblock" command

  Notes:
    - You cannot block yourself
    - Blocking is one-way (they can still receive your messages unless they block you)
    - Blocks persist through logouts and server restarts
    - Admins and moderators may still be able to contact you for moderation purposes
    - This only affects channel messages, not game mechanics or interactions

  Privacy:
    - Your block list is private and only visible to you
    - Blocked users are not notified when you block or unblock them
    - No public indication that someone is on your block list
