  DWARF RACE OVERVIEW

    Dwarves are born in vaulted halls where anvils ring like temple bells. Their
  clan ledgers record every alloy poured, tunnel carved, and oath sworn -
  history literally hammered into the mountain's bones. Outsiders meet them as
  grim-faced engineers or ale-swilling champions, but each dwarf carries an
  artisan's heart, measuring worth by the creations they leave behind.

    Thick frames, inexhaustible lungs, and iron discipline make dwarves
  consummate defenders. Strength and vitality rise rapidly while agility
  barely budges, so they excel at holding bottlenecks, shrugging off poison,
  and punishing enemies who dare break their shieldwall. Their mana pool grows
  slowly; use it to reinforce defensive runes or surge forward with a single,
  brutal stone-endurance burst rather than trying to out-sling arcanists.
