  TABAXI RACE OVERVIEW

    Tabaxi hail from sun-drenched jungles and cliffside villages where every
  tribe preserves folktales through elaborate dances. They treat curiosity as
  a sacred duty: each adventurer is expected to return with artifacts, gossip,
  or at least a novel dessert recipe. Travelers seeking guides in dangerous
  lands often hire tabaxi simply because no one explores faster.

    Their agility is peerless, far outpacing improvements to strength or
  intellect, which makes them phenomenal scouts, archers, and skirmishers.
  Health and mana stay modest, so they rely on feline-agility bursts,
  acrobatics, and curious-whiskers intuition to stay alive. If you want to
  blitz around battlefields, steal objectives, and narrate your own legend
  mid-leap, this race embraces that high-energy playstyle.
