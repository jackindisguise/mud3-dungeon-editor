  WARDEN CLASS OVERVIEW

    Wardens are oath-bound sentinels who stand between calamity and the innocent.
  Their cloaks smell of pine sap and forge smoke, and the shields they carry are
  etched with the names of keeps they have defended. When the horns sound they
  plant their feet, whisper a quiet prayer, and become immovable walls of steel.

    The class leans heavily into stamina, defense, and crowd control. Strength and
  vitality rise quickly, granting chunky health pools and the ability to soak
  damage that would flatten others. Mana and agility grow slowly, so their spellwork
  focuses on protective auras and taunts rather than flashy offense. If your party
  needs someone to anchor the line, the warden chassis was built for that duty.
