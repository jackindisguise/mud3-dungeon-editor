  SKYPIEAN RACE OVERVIEW

    Skypieans live on floating archipelagos far above storm clouds, harvesting
  vapor reefs and shaping them into living architecture. Their wings are
  ceremonial, so they rely on dial technology - wind shells, impact cranks,
  thunder stores - to traverse the heavens. Every visitor is treated to
  storm-forecast rituals and aerial dances that retell the migration of their
  cloud cities.

    Agile bodies and curious minds define the race: agility and intellect grow
  quickly, feeding a healthy mana pool ideal for weather magic or gadgetry,
  while raw strength develops slowly. Skypieans shine as mobile skirmishers or
  support casters who dart across battlefields using dial-surge bursts and
  cloud-glider leaps. Keep moving, strike from elevated terrain, and let
  complacent groundlings learn why the sky-borne are feared.
