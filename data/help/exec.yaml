  EXEC - Execute JavaScript Code (Admin Only)

  Usage:
    exec <code>
    exec =<code>

  The exec command allows administrators to execute arbitrary JavaScript code
  on the server. This is a powerful debugging and administration tool that
  provides direct access to the game's runtime environment.

  The command supports both synchronous and asynchronous code execution.

  Return Value Prefix (=):
    Starting your code with '=' ensures the return value is printed to you.
    This is useful for quickly inspecting values without writing sendMessage.

  Examples:
    exec console.log("Hello World")
    exec =context.room.contents.length
    exec context.actor.sendMessage("Test", MESSAGE_GROUP.SYSTEM)
    exec =context.actor.mob.display
    exec context.game.broadcast("Server announcement!")
    exec =await someAsyncFunction()

  Available Variables:
    context - The command context containing:
      - context.actor    - The mob executing the command
      - context.room     - The current room (may be undefined)

  Return Values:
    - When using '=', the return value will be displayed as JSON
    - Without '=', return values are not automatically displayed
    - If no value is returned (or without '='), you'll see "Code executed successfully"
    - Errors are caught and displayed
    - Async functions are supported - use 'await' for promises

  Security:
    This command is RESTRICTED to admin users only. Regular players cannot
    access this command. Admins are automatically granted to localhost
    connections.

  Warning:
    This command can modify game state, create/delete objects, and execute
    any JavaScript code. Use with caution!
