  HALF-ORC RACE OVERVIEW

    Half-orcs live between worlds: the clan fires that forged them and the
  cities that judge them by tusk and temper. Many become mercenary vanguards
  or caravan guards, hiring out their brute strength in exchange for stories,
  steel, or a place to belong. Their traditions celebrate scars as memoirs and
  sharpened axes as family heirlooms.

    They have formidable strength and endurance, with health bars that rise
  quickly enough to keep them in the fray long after subtler fighters fall.
  Agility gains are steady but unspectacular, and scholarly pursuits come
  slowly, so magic-heavy builds take effort. Lean on relentless-endurance
  bursts, brutal momentum, and savage attacks to overwhelm foes; you can live
  out the berserker fantasy while still possessing enough finesse to adapt.
