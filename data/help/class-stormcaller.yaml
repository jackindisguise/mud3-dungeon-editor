  STORMCALLER CLASS OVERVIEW

    Stormcallers braid bardic canticles with turbulent weather. They travel with
  choirs of thunder spirits, conducting lightning like an orchestra while their
  allies fight beneath the shelter of gale-song wards. Concert halls and battlefields
  feel the same to them—both places to unleash crescendos that rattle bones.

    Their attribute growth skews toward intellect, mana, and a healthy dash of
  agility, letting them cast repeatedly while kite-dancing around melee threats.
  Strength lags, so they avoid protracted brawls in favor of ranged bursts,
  control effects, and party buffs that ride crackling winds. In coordinated groups
  a stormcaller becomes the pulse of the team, setting tempo and keeping enemies
  constantly off-balance.
